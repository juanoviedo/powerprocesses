                <h4>Cali, 05/2023</h4>
                <p>
                    This page was created to inform the consumables customers about the capabilities of each
                    input. Also to inform them that they are dealing with an expert in the subject of plasma
                    cutting, offer them a free value service as anchor or hook and special services for their
                    machinery. In this way, obtain a differential value with the competition in quality and
                    service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the biggest projects that have accompanied my life has been to create a
                    system that notifies car users if they are in rush hour (Peak hour, pico y placa), this to avoid being fined.
                    I have developed two hardware devices and a WhatsApp chatbot system in order to
                    notify users of rush hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This page was created to publicize the second version of the hardware device of the project.

                <h2>Plasma CNC Steel Cutter</h2>
                <h4>Cali, 2021</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a project that I'm proud of because I had to put into practice almost all my
                    previous working experience, from the technical aspects to build the machine to the
                    sales skills to find a client. Take a look at the web site by pressing the button
                    below. It was made thinking about what could be improved; this machine has innovative
                    speed and acceleration and was built with national aluminum profiles for
                    cost optimization.

                <p>
                    This page was originally a Django website connected with a beautiful and powerful
                    PostgreSQL database, in which I only had to post my new stories or projects as a
                    Facebook-like social website, but because of the new Heroku fee policy, I decided
                    to make this website static.

                <h4>Cali, 2016</h4>
                <p>
                    In 2016, I graduated as an electronic engineer from the Xaverian University of Cali, and
                    started learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This was the first website I created. It
                    was different than now, but it was responsive and had the same menu as today. This
                    page has a beautiful image carousel designed fully by me, and I used only Javascript
                    to make it.
